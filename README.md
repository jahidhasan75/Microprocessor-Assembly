Assembly Language Programming (8086 / .asm Codes)

This repository contains simple and structured 8086 Assembly Language programs for learning and practicing microprocessor fundamentals — covering data movement, arithmetic operations, loops, strings, and system calls using INT 21h.
Each code is designed for educational purposes, helping students understand how low-level instructions interact with CPU registers and memory.

⚙️ How to Run Assembly Code in VS Code
Follow these simple steps to run .asm files in Visual Studio Code:

OPEN VS CODE
Launch Visual Studio Code on your computer.

INSTALL EXTENSION

Open Extensions (Ctrl + Shift + X / Cmd + Shift + X)
Search for “MASM/TASM”
Install the extension
CREATE ASM FILE

Create a new file with .asm extension (e.g., hello.asm)
Write your assembly code in the file
RUN THE CODE

Right-click anywhere in your .asm file
Select “Run ASM code”
The DOSBox emulator will open and execute your program
NOTES:

The extension uses DOSBox to emulate 8086 execution
Ensure your code follows standard 8086 assembly syntax
Program output appears in the emulator window
